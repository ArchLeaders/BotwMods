# Collision Actors
> [Collision Actors-v1.0.5.bnp](https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=74309C0E337BBADE&resid=74309C0E337BBADE%21333217&authkey=AB7DGXhsMSNU0Jg)

Every *applicable* actor in the game duplicated with collision.

Actors names are the same as vanilla but with a `C` at the end.

E.g. `TwnObj_TempleOfTime_A_01` is `TwnObj_TempleOfTime_A_01C`

_If you are creating mods with Collision Actors use [Actor Loader](https://gamebanana.com/tools/7904)_

WIP - If any actor is missing a new one can be created with **Vanilla Collision Creator**.
