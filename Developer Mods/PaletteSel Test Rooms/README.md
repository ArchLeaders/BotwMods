This mod is aimed at mod developers; do not use it when playing the game.<br.
I would also recommend that you create a new save game when using this mod.<br>
It adds over 1000 new game data flags which could mess up your save game.<br>

## So what are the PaletteSel Test Rooms?

These so-called "rooms" are just 10x10x10 cube-like structures lined up in AocField. Each one has a different PaletteSel value (1-255) and can be quickly accessed via the mass of 255 warp points crammed in the bottom left of the map.

To find the PaletteSel value of the room Link is currently occupying, open the save menu and observe the number in place of the region.

## Known Issues

The cursor always jumps back to Korok forest when in AocField, this is a bit annoying but I could not figure out how to fix it.

_If you find any bugs or have a question, please create an issue with details!_
